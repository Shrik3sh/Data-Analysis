We had a bad situation recently. Look over here.

We had a sinister former employee who went around the company, requesting donations for their kid's soccer team.

And look at this person's eyebrows. He's sinister, look at that.

People felt intimidated and here is a list of our people from Gail Archer down to Martina Zornan

And here is a list of donations. And our objectives.

We need three separate query results.One, our people who did not donate
and then people who donated less than $200 and then people who donated $200 or more.

Now, let's look at the data. Notice, Stu Glover donated a total of $210.

If Stu Glover is one of our people, then he needs to be on the greater than or equal to $200 result.

Let's see if Stu Glover is one of ours. Yes, Stu Glover is one of ours.

Then let's look at a couple other things. Jeff Benford and Dorian Canter are on the top of this list.

Are they our people? We do have Jeff Benford.

We don't have a Dorian Canter. thats greate proves our formula works
