We've got a January through March file
and then an April through June file.
And they both have the same column headers
in the same place.
This is all volunteer data
showing volunteerism in three categories,
culinary arts, tech and music.
This shows that Abbey Rowe in April through June
volunteered 15 hours in the area of culinary arts.


What do we want to do with it?
Our objectives: 
1 get the data into one file.But use Power Query to do it,

2 Then get a total for each person and the category that they volunteered in.

3 Then we only want to keep the people who volunteered in music.

4 We don't want the people who worked in tech or in culinary arts.

5 Then sort that result by the last name, then by the first name
