OBJECTIVES 
• Match each order with the right price from the 
pricing grid. 
• Get rid of the order types; i.e., PHONE, ONLINE, 
WEBSITE.

items are not needed in the result. 
• Sort the result by dollar amount, Iargest to 
smallest. 


 we've got some order data about pies.

Column B are the order numbers,

and it's broken up into sections.

We've got orders that came in through the phone,

online, through the website, that's everything.

And then, on the right side, we have a pricing grid.

So we see that a whole sweet potato costs $26.

So, for the order that's in column three,

that's seven whole sweet potato pies,

that should be $26 times seven.

And that's what we want to do.

That's our first objective.

Get the prices matched up with the right products.

But notice there's a challenge.

Sweet Potato__W means whole pie, and then we get

to Strawberry Rhubarb__S, that means slice.

That's $6 for a strawberry rhubarb slice.

And then we get down to row 10, Mixed Berry__M, 3,

that means three mini pies.

So, what do we want to do with this data?

Here is our list of objectives.

Match each order with the right price.

We don't need those headers, PHONE, ONLINE, and WEBSITE.

We aren't making the distinction with those.

Get a total dollar amount for each order,

and we do not need the items.

And what does that mean?

Notice this order.

That's eight items in one order.

We want the final price.

We do not care that it's got Key lime pies and slices,

We just want the order number and the dollar amount,

We do a Left outter Join
what do we want to match it is pie and flavor_size.1 and Type with flavor__size.2
